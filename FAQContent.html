                        Mazda Finance is committed to giving consideration and assistance to customers who are experiencing financial hardship.

                        Financial hardship involves an inability, rather than an unwillingness, to pay and may be attributed to unforeseen factors including loss of employment, family breakdown, illness, injury or even the death of a family member. Hardship can even encompass situations where customers are impacted by natural disasters such as fire or flooding.

                        For individual or small business customers suffering financial hardship, Mazda Finance may be able to assist in a number of ways including deferring payments, capitalisation of arrears, a moratorium or reducing the payments.
                        In order to assess your eligibility for financial hardship assistance we require you to complete a "hardship application". Once this has been completed and returned to us, one of our representatives will contact you to discuss alternative solutions available.

                        You can request a hardship application by writing to The Hardship Team, Mazda Finance, PO Box 1354 Macquarie Park NSW 2113. Call us direct on 138 500 or email <a href="mailtohardship@mazdafinance.com.au"><strong>hardship@mazdafinance.com.au</strong></a>

                        You can obtain a final payout quote from Mazda Finance Online along with details of how to make the final payment.  We won’t confirm this amount to the purchaser without your authorisation,
                        so please provide them with your account number and Payout ID, or simply pass them a copy of the Payout letter that you can access at the site.

                        To ensure a smooth finalisation of your contract, it is important to have an accurate payout figure calculated. If you want to payout the loan in full, log in to Mazda Finance Online and simply calculate a figure from the Payout Quote page and finalise the contract. You can also access your EFT or BPAY details on this page.

                        By navigating to the Payout Quote page you will be able to calculate a figure for any business day up to the next monthly due date and generate a Payout Letter if you need it.

                        It is important to note that the payout quote will assume that any recent payments have been honoured. In the event that a recent payment dishonours, there will be a shortfall and the contract will not be finalised until this amount, along with any dishonour fees, have been paid.

Based on this, Mazda Finance will guarantee the minimum future value of your new Mazda, otherwise known as the Guaranteed Future Value (GFV). When your term is up, you have the flexibility to trade, keep or return your car to Mazda Finance. So as your circumstances change your car can too, thanks to Mazda Assured.

                        new model data and economic factors, with your loan term and agreed End Odometer factored in.

                        The Guaranteed Future Value (GFV) is the minimum value that Mazda Finance believes your vehicle will be worth at the end of your contract term. This is subject to the vehicle being returned in a condition that meets Fair Wear and Tear guidelines, and not having travelled more kilometres than agreed. With this in mind,
                        the Guaranteed Future Value (GFV) may be more or less than the actual value of the vehicle.

                        If your vehicle doesn't meet Fair Wear and Tear guidelines, Mazda Finance will give you the opportunity to have the vehicle repaired. Otherwise, Mazda Finance can organise the repairs and deduct the cost from your Guaranteed Future Value (GFV). This adjusted Guaranteed Future Value (GFV) will then be the price that Mazda Finance will offer you if you return the car at the end of your term. Of course, if you keep the vehicle, the condition doesn't matter.
                        And if you trade it in or sell it privately, the condition will obviously impact your sale price.

                        Yes. Providing your vehicle meets the Fair Wear and Tear guidelines and you have not travelled more kilometres
                        than agreed, Mazda Finance will use your Guaranteed Future Value (GFV) to pay the final payment.

                        An excess usage adjustment will apply if, at the end of the term, you have travelled more than the agreed End Odometer. This will be deducted from your Guaranteed Future Value
                        (GFV), which then becomes your adjusted Guaranteed Future Value (GFV).

                        Mazda Assured is competitively priced. As the final payment equates to the Guaranteed Future Value (GFV), the interest is higher than that of a loan with a similar amount and term without a balloon final payment. Of course, the deposit and any prepayment of monthly payments will help reduce charges.

You will need to negotiate with the owner of the vehicle to ensure the loan is paid out in full before the vehicle can be transferred into your name. If you purchase the vehicle and
                        the vehicle is not paid out in full, Mazda will retain an interest in the vehicle.

                        Mazda Finance is committed to giving consideration and assistance to customers who are experiencing financial hardship.

                        Financial hardship involves an inability, rather than an unwillingness, to pay and may be attributed to unforeseen factors including loss of employment, family breakdown, illness, injury or even the death of a family member. Hardship can even encompass situations where customers are impacted by natural disasters such as fire or flooding.

                        For individual or small business customers suffering financial hardship, Mazda Finance may be able to assist in a number of ways including deferring payments, capitalisation of arrears, a moratorium or reducing the payments.

                        In order to assess your eligibility for financial hardship assistance we require you to complete a "hardship application". Once this has been completed and returned to us, one of our representatives will contact you to discuss alternative solutions available.

                        You can request a hardship application by writing to The Hardship Team, Mazda Finance, PO Box 1354 Macquarie Park NSW 2113. Call us direct on 138 500 or email the Hardship Team.

                        The most common payment method is direct debit. You can nominate to make your payments weekly, fortnightly or monthly to suit your pay cycle.  There is no charge to make your payments by direct debit.

                        You can elect to make extra payments to pay your loan off sooner, which may save you interest over the term of your loan depending on your type of loan.

                        You can elect to pay your loan by EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer), Post Billpay or BPAY. Please note that a payment method fee will apply for all payments other than direct debit.

                        Using EFT you can set up regular payments or make a one-off transfer from your bank account using internet banking. Simply register Mazda Finance as the payee by using the BSB and Account Number provided to you. The Account Name for EFT is Mazda Finance.

                        To ensure a smooth finalisation of your contract, it is important to have an accurate payout figure calculated. If you want to payout the loan in full, log in to Mazda Finance Online and simply calculate a figure from the Payout Quote page and finalise the contract. You can also access your EFT or BPAY details on this page.

                        By navigating to the Payout Quote page you will be able to calculate a figure for any business day up to the next monthly due date and generate a Payout Letter if you need it.
                        You can authorise a once off direct debit free of charge by contacting our National Customer Solutions Centre on 138 500.

                        It is important to note that the payout quote will assume that any recent payments have been honoured. In the event that a recent payment dishonours, there will be a shortfall and the contract will not be finalised until this amount, along with any dishonour fees, have been paid.

                        You may wish to provide a copy of this letter to your insurance company, as many insurers will offer a lower premium if the vehicle is no longer under finance.
                        If you were making your payments by direct debit, this will automatically be cancelled to ensure that no more payments are deducted.

                        Mazda Finance will remove its security over the vehicle when the final payment has been allocated to your loan and there is no outstanding balance due and that payment has been cleared by your financial institution. The time required for payment clearance is dependent upon the payment method and may take up to 8 business days. Paying by BPAY through your financial institution to finalise
                        your loan is the best payment method for timely removal of our security over the vehicle.

                        Mazda Finance is committed to giving consideration and assistance to customers who are experiencing financial hardship.

                        Financial hardship involves an inability, rather than an unwillingness, to pay and may be attributed to unforeseen factors including loss of employment, family breakdown, illness, injury or even the death of a family member. Hardship can even encompass situations where customers are impacted by natural disasters such as fire or flooding.

                        For individual or small business customers suffering financial hardship, Mazda Finance may be able to assist in a number of ways including deferring payments, capitalisation of arrears, a moratorium or reducing the payments.

                        In order to assess your eligibility for financial hardship assistance we require you to complete a "hardship application". Once this has been completed and returned to us, one of our representatives will contact you to discuss alternative solutions available.

                        You can request a hardship application by writing to The Hardship Team, Mazda Finance, PO Box 1354, Macquarie Park NSW 2113. Call us direct on 138 500 or email<a href="Hardship@mazdafinance.com.au"> Hardship@mazdafinance.com.au</a>

                        To ensure a smooth finalisation of your contract, it is important to have an accurate payout figure calculated. By navigating to the Payout Quote page you will be able to calculate a figure for any business day up to the next monthly due date.

                        It is important to note that the payout quote will assume that any recent payments have been honoured. In the event that a recent payment dishonours, there will be a shortfall and the contract will not be finalised until this amount, along with any dishonour fees, have been paid.
